# Guess The Imposter!

### "three of us knows the word, one doesn't, guess the imposter!"

The social deduction game taking the internet by storm, now open-source!

Try to vote out the imposter after 3 rounds! If you're the imposter, try to blend in!

## User Guide

A selected word is distributed to everyone but one person. The category / topic is also revealed.

Turn order is decided randomly. There are 3 (or customizable) rounds to go around, at the end, vote the imposter out!

#### Tip: During rounds, players can feel free to chat about notes via chat feature or in person!

Coming soon: new modifiers

NOTE: Players who receive the correct word will be referred to as "innocent" from here on out!

### Innocents:

When it is your turn, try to write one word that clues in the selected WITHOUT giving the word away!

#### Tip: Be a little vague while also staying on topic!

Innocents will have to vote the imposter out at the end of the rounds.

Innocents lose when they either:

1. Vote out the wrong imposter.
2. The imposter voted out guesses the right word.

Innocents win when:

1. The imposter voted out guesses the incorrect word.

### Imposter:

You will not be given the selected word. However, the category / topic is revealed to everyone!

When it is your turn, try to "blend in" and write a word that doesn't give you away!

At the same time, use other players' guesses to come up with the correct word.

At the end of the rounds, avoid suspicion. If you're caught, make sure you have a good idea what the word is!

Imposter loses when:

1. They are voted out correctly at the end of the rounds AND do not guess the correct word.

Imposter wins when they either:

1. Avoid suspicion and don't get voted out.
2. Get voted out BUT guess the correct word.
